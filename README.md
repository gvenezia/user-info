# User Info with React
This simple, bare bones web app displays information that would be commonly found on social media sites. I used this project to learn more about React.

### How was it built?
I followed Tyler McGinnis's [tutorial](https://tylermcginnis.com/reactjs-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide-to-building-apps-with-react/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
